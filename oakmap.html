              City Challenge Oakland - Mapping the Challenges
            </h3>
             <p>The City Challenge Oakland engages Oakland residents to co-design solutions to three key issues identified by public officials along with Civil Society Organizations: Illegal Dumping, poor conditions in Homeless Encampments, and violent crime.
      The goal of the City Challenge is to help Oakland transition from closed-door to open and collaborative governance, where the City codesigns solutions to public problems with residents.</p>

      <p>The initial step of the process is to define the problems and outline some possible root causes. To aid in that process and in communicating the problems, this web app maps the available data on them
      to Oakland's Police Beats. </p>
      Learn more about the city challenge  <a href="https://oakland.mycitychallenge.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><nobr>here</nobr></a>, or use the buttons below to explore the data.

            About the data
          </h3>
          <p> The data from this project comes from Oakland's Open Data Portal. Illegal dumping and homeless encampment data come from Oakland's <a href="https://data.oaklandca.gov/Infrastructure/Service-requests-received-by-the-Oakland-Call-Cent/quth-gb8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><nobr>311 Service Requests dataset</nobr></a>.
           Meanwhile, violent crime data comes from <a href="https://data.oaklandca.gov/Public-Safety/CrimeWatch-Data/ppgh-7dqv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><nobr>CrimeWath</nobr></a>. </p>
           <p> It is important to note that this is reported data.  It does not represent the absolute value of incidence of these issues, but where they are most reported. It is swayed by biases, inequities in access to information, trust in government, policing, access to language, etc. Keep this in mind while you explore.
           </p>
