             <p style="margin-left:100px; margin-right: 100px; margin-top: 20px;">Hi, I’m Frederico Levy, but I usually go by Fred. I’m an urban studies researcher and geospatial analyst. I’m interested in how we use and implement technology to solve urban problems and make cities more open, equitable and liveable. I’m a recent graduate from the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, with a BS in Sustainable Urban Environments, and a minor in Urban Informatics. There, I have focused on digital infrastructure, and urban mobility with a particular interest in bicycling and walking. I’ve grown familiar with drawing data from everything from documents buried deep in the city’s archives to remote sensing data collected by satellites hovering far overhead. 
              At GovLab, I worked with partners like the City of Oakland, the Select Committee for the Modernization of Congress and the Inter-American Development Bank to improve how policy makers and lawmakers use evidence and technology, as well as engage their respective communities.
